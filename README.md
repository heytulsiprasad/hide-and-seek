***Hey***

Ever played the game of matching the tiles in your childhood? Yes, then its just that with a super minimal experience. 

There are **two** modes for playing this game, **Auto** and **Manual**.

The **Auto** mode lets you see your **time consumed** until you finish the game's last level, i.e. *Level 3*.

The **Manual** mode lets you choose which **level** you want to play.

There are three levels for this game, **Easy, Medium** and **Hard**. And you finish the game only after finishing the toughest level (*Hard*).

**Note**: If you want to **explore** the **SASS** code for this project, go to the **Timer** branch.

## Made with :raised_hands:, :eyes: and :brain: and ofcourse a :computer:

You're right, **HTML, CSS (SASS), and JS (jQuery)** with :heart:
